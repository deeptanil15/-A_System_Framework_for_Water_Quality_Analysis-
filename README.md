# Water-Quality-and-Health-Risk-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning-for-Sustainable-Drinking-Water-SystemS
## 1. Project Overview
In this project, I focused on analyzing water quality and associated health risks using machine learning techniques to ensure sustainable drinking water systems. My goal was to assess and predict water quality to prevent health risks caused by waterborne diseases and contaminants. Machine learning models were used to identify patterns in water quality data and provide insights for improving water safety and sustainability.

## 2. Objectives
### Assess Water Quality: I aimed to evaluate the quality of drinking water by analyzing various physicochemical parameters such as pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), and concentrations of harmful substances like lead or arsenic.
### Health Risk Prediction: I intended to predict potential health risks based on water contamination levels, allowing for early detection and intervention.
### Sustainable Water Management: I wanted to support decision-makers in improving water treatment and management strategies for sustainable and safe drinking water systems.
## 3. Data Collection and Preprocessing
### Data Sources: I gathered water quality data from sources like government records, environmental agencies, or real-time sensors in various locations.
### Features: The dataset included water quality indicators such as pH, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), nitrate concentration, and microbial counts (e.g., E. coli).
### Preprocessing: I cleaned the data, handled missing values, and standardized the features for machine learning models. Techniques like normalization or feature scaling were used to prepare the data for analysis.
## 4. Machine Learning Models
I implemented several machine learning models to analyze water quality and predict health risks. These included:

### Supervised Learning Models: I used algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify water samples as "safe" or "unsafe."
### Regression Models: To predict continuous values like contaminant concentrations, I employed models such as Linear Regression or Gradient Boosting.
### Ensemble Learning: To improve model accuracy, I used ensemble techniques like Bagging or Boosting, which combine multiple weak learners into a strong predictive model.
## 5. Health Risk Assessment
### Risk Calculation: Based on the water quality predictions, I built a risk scoring system to quantify potential health risks (e.g., exposure to toxins or pathogens).
### Thresholds: I set thresholds for acceptable contaminant levels (e.g., WHO or EPA standards), and any deviations were flagged as health risks.
### Prediction Accuracy: I tested my models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure that they correctly predict water quality and health risks.
## 6. Results and Insights
### Model Performance: The machine learning models I developed provided accurate predictions of water quality based on historical and real-time data.
### Actionable Insights: My system identified specific water sources or regions at higher risk, enabling authorities to prioritize areas for treatment or monitoring.
### Sustainability: The model supports long-term sustainability by helping to optimize water treatment processes, ensuring a cleaner and safer water supply system.
## 7. Significance of the Project
Public Health Impact: By accurately predicting water quality and potential health risks, my system contributes to reducing waterborne diseases and improving public health outcomes.
### Sustainability: The project promotes sustainable water management practices by providing data-driven insights into water quality, helping to ensure that clean drinking water is accessible.
### Scalability: My machine learning models can be scaled to different regions or integrated with IoT sensors in smart cities to continuously monitor water quality.
## 8. Future Work
### Real-Time Monitoring: I plan to integrate real-time data from IoT devices to monitor water quality continuously and update predictions dynamically.
### Deep Learning: I am exploring deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), for more complex feature extraction and time-series analysis.
